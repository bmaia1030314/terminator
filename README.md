## Calculations

### Mutual Agreement
```
Gross Payout = (Annual Salary Ã· 12) Ã— Compensation Months
```

### Contract Termination (Simplified MVP)
```
Gross Payout = (Annual Salary Ã· 365) Ã— 12 Ã— Full Years of Service
```

> **Note**: The termination calculation uses a simplified baseline (12 days per year) for MVP purposes. Real Portuguese labor law includes time-based bands, caps, and various exceptions.
